# 42_pipex
the amazing and beautiful pipex x project which aim to introduce us to the world of pipes and executing commands with the proper validations! 
just git clone and run as follow 
{ ./pipex infile "cmd1" "cmd2" outfile }
cmd1 && cmd2 -> is the first command u want to execute and if it have multiple words u should wrap between strings
infile -> should be a valid file with open permission to READ WRITE AND EXECUTE
outfile -> could be any file name u want to get ur output to! 
#goood luck and have fun exploring pipex
